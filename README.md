# 15-112-Term-Project: Elephant Survival Safari
This is my term project for 15-112. 

## Description
The term project is called “Elephant Safari Survival.” The project is designed to game-ify elephants by having the player act in the role of an elephant in a survival-style game. Following a scroll-through start screen where the player can toggle to directions or the game, they start as a baby elephant and grow to become an adult, and eventually an elder. The goal of the game is to both survive and complete challenges. 

There are three general life stages for the player elephant that correspond roughly to easy, medium, and hard levels of game play: baby, adult, and elder life stages. In all stages, the player is trying to make sure that their elephant gets enough water, enough food, and enough sleep. As a baby, the player’s goal is to find their mother. As an adult, the player’s main goal is to to build their herd, feeding them and giving them water. When the player reaches the elder phase, the player has to deal with a death in the herd, finding and paying their respects to the skeleton.

## How To Run The Project
If you run the main.py file, you shall open the game and can play it. Please make sure all of the files in the zip file submitted are present.

## Which Libraries Are Being Used
Asides from cmu_112_graphics.py and random, I have not used any libraries or imports.

## Shortcut Commands
There is a toggle that allows the player to turn off the controlling death mechanics so they can easily check the challenges working without having to worry about mainting the elephants thirst, hunger, and energy. You press “o” to turn the controls on and off in the game mode.

Other commands for the game can be found in the help mode in the game, which can be accessed either by pressing "h" in the start mode or in the game mode.
